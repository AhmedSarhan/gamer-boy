### Key Architecture Principles

- **Shared Resources** (`src/shared/`): Reusable UI components, hooks, types, and utilities
- **Feature Modules** (`src/modules/`): Self-contained feature-specific code
- **Kebab-case Naming**: All files and folders use kebab-case (e.g., `search-bar.tsx`)
- **Folder-per-Component**: Each component lives in its own folder with related files
- **Barrel Exports**: Clean imports through index files

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gamer-boy
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Playwright browsers (for E2E testing):

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint errors
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Run E2E tests with UI
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - Run E2E tests in headed mode
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate database migrations
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio to view/edit database
- `npm run scrape:games` - Scrape games from GameDistribution.com

## Database

This project uses **SQLite** with **Drizzle ORM** for data management. The database file (`games.db`) is created automatically when you run migrations.

### Viewing the Database

To view and edit the database using Drizzle Studio (visual database browser):

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

This will open a web interface at `http://localhost:4983` where you can:

- Browse all games and categories
- View relationships between tables
- Edit data directly
- Run queries

### Database Schema

- **categories** table: Stores game categories (Action, Puzzle, Arcade, etc.)
- **games** table: Stores game data with foreign key to categories

### Adding Games

#### Option 1: Using the Scraper Script (Recommended)

The scraper has two modes:

**Load from JSON (default - fast):**

```bash
npm run scrape:games
```

This loads games from `src/data/games.json` if it exists. Perfect for quick setup!

**Fresh scrape from GameDistribution.com:**

```bash
npm run scrape:games:fresh
```

This will:

1. Visit GameDistribution.com and scrape game listings
2. Visit each game's individual page to extract genres
3. Create categories from the official genre list (26 genres)
4. Save scraped data to `src/data/games.json` for future use
5. Insert games into the database

**Note:** Fresh scraping visits individual game pages, so it takes longer but provides accurate genre data. The JSON file serves as fallback/starter data so you don't need to scrape every time.

#### Option 2: Manual Addition via Drizzle Studio

1. Run `npm run db:studio`
2. Navigate to the `games` table
3. Click "Add row" and fill in the game data
4. Make sure to select an existing `category_id`

#### Option 3: Programmatically

You can add games programmatically by importing the database:

```typescript
import { db } from "@/db/index";
import { games } from "@/db/schema";

await db.insert(games).values({
  id: "unique-game-id",
  title: "Game Title",
  description: "Game description",
  thumbnail: "https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg",
  iframeUrl: "https://html5.gamedistribution.com/[game-id]",
  categoryId: "action", // Must match an existing category id
});
```

## Game Categories/Genres

Games are categorized using the official GameDistribution.com genres:

- Casual, Puzzle, Adventure, Dress-up, Racing & Driving, Shooter, Agility, Simulation, Battle, Art, Match-3, .IO, Mahjong & Connect, Strategy, Care, Sports, Cards, Football, Cooking, Bubble Shooter, Educational, Jigsaw, Merge, Boardgames, Basketball, Quiz

Games can have multiple genres/categories.

## E2E Testing

E2E tests are located in the `e2e/` directory and use Playwright.

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run tests with UI:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Code Quality

This project uses:

- **ESLint** for linting (Next.js config + Prettier integration)
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **TypeScript** strict mode (no `any` types)

Format code:

```bash
npm run format
```

Check linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```
